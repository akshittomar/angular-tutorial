<h2>Signal Tutorial </h2>

<p><strong>What is a Signal?</strong> A signal is a special kind of reactive value that notifies the system when it changes, allowing automatic updates to parts of the application that depend on it.</p>

<p><strong>Signal vs Normal Value:</strong> Signals trigger <code>effect()</code> functions to run whenever their value changes, enabling reactive updates. In contrast, normal values do not trigger <code>effect()</code> and changes to them do not automatically update dependent parts of the application.</p>

<p>Value of Signal <small style="background-color: rgb(170, 170, 170);"> check console it triggers effect every time </small> : {{val()}}</p>
<p>Value of Data : {{x}}</p>

<button (click)="signalUpdate()"  >Update Signal Value</button> <br><br>
<button (click)="dataUpdate()"  >Update Data Value</button><br>
<div>
    <span>There are 2 types of Signals : 1. Computed Signal 2 . Wrtitable Signal</span>
</div><br>
<p>1.Computed Signal : this is a signal that cannot be changed directly (they don't have set or update property). It is derived from other signals or values.</p>
<p>Computed Value depends on value of 'val() Signal' <small style="background-color: rgb(170, 170, 170);" >(Click on Update Signal Value button)</small>  : <strong>{{computedValue()}}</strong> </p>
<p>2.Writable Signal :  this is a signal that can hold a number, string, or boolean value
 WritableSignal allows you to change the value of the signal directly without any dependency </p>
<p>Different Values of a Writable Signal : {{differentValue()}}</p> &nbsp;&nbsp; <button (click)="updateDifferentValue()" >Change Datatype</button>
<p>Note :  Computed signals in Angular should have a single, consistent type—they cannot hold multiple types like number | string | boolean at different times. </p>

<p>Each effect only reacts to the signals used inside its own function.

If you have an effect that only uses signal a, it will only run when a changes.
If you have another effect that only uses signal b, it will only run when b changes.
Signal a cannot trigger the effect for signal b, and vice versa.
Each effect is independent and only tracks the signals it accesses.</p>
