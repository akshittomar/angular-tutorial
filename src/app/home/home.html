<p>home works!</p>

<a [routerLink]="['/profile', { name: 'Akshit Tomar' }]">
  Go to Profile Page
</a>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  Use an <em>absolute</em> link with a leading '/' —
  e.g.
  <code>['/profile', {{ '{' }}...{{ '}' }}]</code>
  navigates to
  <code>/profile</code>
  from anywhere.
  Without the leading '/', the link is <em>relative</em> —
  e.g.
  <code>['profile']</code>
  resolves from the current route
  (from <code>/home</code> it becomes <code>/home/profile</code>).
